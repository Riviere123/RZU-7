--------------------------------RENDER LIMITER-----------------------

Render Limiter Game Object-
attached is the render limiter scriot


In this scene I have 3 render limiters to show how we can section off zones of our map.
-------------options-----------
box Size: this is the size of the box. everything inside this box will be hidden when rendered = false.

Rendered: turn it on to enable the objects turn it off to disable them.


When an object is disabled it is like it is not in the world, no scripts on the object will run no sounds from the object will play and you will not see the object.



NOTES

This adds all the objects inside the box to a list at AWAKE which means that anything added to the map after this will NOT be on the list and will NOT be removed. this is intentional and can be changed if needed.
