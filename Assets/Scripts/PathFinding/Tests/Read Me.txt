ENABLE GIZMOS AT THE TOP OF YOUR SCENE VIEW

Grid script options:
Wall Mask - this is the Layer that our grid is looking for to determine if that node contains something that is not passable.

Grid World Size - this controls the size of this grid in world size. If you have gizmos enabled you can see your changes effect the white outline so you can physically see how large of a zone you are creating

Start Position - This is the position in the world of the grid. again if you change the x or y values you will see the white gizmo box move as well.

NodeRadius - The smaller the node radius the more acurate the collision detection is with objects. This is because to compensate for a smaller node radius we create more. The higher the node value you can put whiles maintaining good paths the better.

Distance - this is just to help visualize this ONLY effects the gizmo boxes that are created to represent the nodes not the nodes themselves! increasing the distances adds space between the gizmo boxes. think of it as padding.
